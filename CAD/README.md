## Antenna Structure
This section contains the antenna structure CAD files in both Fusion 360 and STEP formats.
Although, only the Fusion 360 version is parametric, as the STEP is only included for 
added compatibility with other CAD sortware.

## Parametric Design
The design parameters may be changed using the Parameter Dialog Box in the Design workpace
(Modify -> Change parameters). The only parameters the user may modify are the _frequency_ 
and _antenna_elements_, as the remaining parameters depend on these two.

## Manufacturing
The component may be exported as STL for 3D printing. Also, the sketches used for each object 
(Avalable as a child object inside each component) may be exported as DXF for laser cutting.
